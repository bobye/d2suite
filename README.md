# d2lib
`d2lib` is a C++ library of discrete distribution
(d2) based data processing framework. It also contains a collection of
computing tools supporting the analysis of d2 data.

*[under construction]*

## Data Format Specifications
 - discrete distribution over Euclidean space
 - discrete distribution with finite possible supports in Euclidean space (e.g., bag-of-word-vectors and sparsified histograms)
 - n-gram data with cross-term distance
 - dense histogram

## Basic Functions
 - distributed/serial IO 
 - compute Wasserstein distance between a pair of D2.


## Learnings
 - nearest neighbors [TBA]
 - D2-clustering [TBA]
 - Dirichlet process [TBA]

## Tools
 - document analysis: from bag-of-words to .d2s format [TBA]
